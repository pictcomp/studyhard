# ML-Lab

## Assignment 1
Perform the following operations using R/Python on suitable data sets:
- Read data from different formats (like csv, xls)
- Find Shape of Data
- Find Missing Values
- Find data type of each column
- Finding out Zero's
- Indexing and selecting data, sort data,
- Describe attributes of data, checking data types of each column,
- Counting unique values of data, format of each column, converting variable data type (e.g. from long to short, vice versa)

## Assignment 2
Perform the following operations using R/Python on the data sets:
- Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset. (e.g. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance and percentiles)
- Illustrate the feature distributions using histogram.
- Data cleaning, Data integration, Data transformation, Data model building (e.g. Classification)

## Assignment 3
Visualize the data using R/Python by plotting the graphs for assignment no. 1 and 2. Consider a suitable data set. Use:
- Scatter plot
- Bar plot
- Box plot
- Pie chart
- Line Chart

## Assignment 4
Apply appropriate ML algorithm on a dataset collected in a cosmetics shop showing details of customers to predict customer response for special offer. Create confusion matrix based on above data and find:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F-1 score

## Assignment 5
Write a program to do following:  
**Data Set:** https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers  
This dataset gives the data of Income and money spent by the customers visiting a shopping mall. The data set contains Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score. Therefore, as a mall owner you need to find the group of people who are the profitable customers for the mall owner. Apply at least two clustering algorithms (based on Spending Score) to find the group of customers.

- Apply Data pre-processing
- Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split)
- Apply Machine Learning Algorithm
- Evaluate Model.
- Apply Cross-Validation and Evaluate Model

## Assignment 6
Assignment on Regression technique.  
Download temperature data from below link.  
https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperatures-of-india?select=temperatures.csv  
This data consists of temperatures of INDIA averaging the temperatures of all places month wise. Temperatures values are recorded in CELSIUS

- Apply Linear Regression using suitable library function and predict the Month-wise temperature.
- Assess the performance of regression models using MSE, MAE and R-Square metrics
- Visualize simple regression model.

## Assignment 7
Assignment on Classification technique  
Every year many students give the GRE exam to get admission in foreign Universities. The data set contains GRE Scores (out of 340), TOEFL Scores (out of 120), University Rating (out of 5), Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5), Letter of Recommendation strength (out of 5), Undergraduate GPA (out of 10), Research Experience (0=no, 1=yes), Admitted (0=no, 1=yes). Admitted is the target variable.  
**Data Set:** https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions  
The counselor of the firm is supposed to check whether the student will get an admission or not based on his/her GRE score and Academic Score. So to help the counselor to take appropriate decisions build a machine learning model classifier using Decision tree to predict whether a student will get admission or not.

- Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding, Data Transformation....) techniques if necessary.
- Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split)
- Apply Machine Learning Algorithm
- Evaluate Model.
